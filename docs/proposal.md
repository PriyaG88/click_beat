- `Paper.js` and `HTML5 Canvas` for DOM manipulation and vector rendering.
- `Howler.js` for audio generation.

### Implementation Timeline

**Over the weekend**:

- [x] Finished event handling for keystrokes
- [x] Set up initial sample sounds.

**Day 1**: Mapping

- [x] Map each key to unique sound
- [x] Map each key to unique shape

**Day 2**: Animations

- [x] Focus on learning paper.js to render animations per shape
- [x] Update each key to render shape and animation

**Day 3**: Animations Pt 2

- [x] Continue animation rendering
- [ ] Create simple instruction banner that populates on user visit and disappears on inital keystroke - 'Press a key, create       a sound'

**Day 4**: Styling

- [ ] Dedicate day to readying app for production

### Bonus Feature:

- [ ] Allow users to upload their own sound source files to provide an individual experience
